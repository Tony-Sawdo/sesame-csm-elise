## Introduction

In today's world, conversational AI is becoming increasingly vital. This repository combines advanced techniques in audio processing and natural language understanding. By leveraging the capabilities of Elise, we aim to create a more human-like interaction experience. 

## Features

- **High-Quality Voice Generation**: Generate clear and engaging audio output.
- **Conversational Context**: Maintain context throughout interactions.
- **Customizable Voice Profiles**: Tailor voice settings to suit different applications.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple APIs for seamless integration into existing systems.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tony-Sawdo/sesame-csm-elise.git
cd sesame-csm-elise
```

Next, install the required dependencies. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the model. Hereâ€™s a basic example to generate speech from text:

```python
from sesame_csm_elise import Elise

elise = Elise()
audio_output = elise.generate_speech("Hello, how can I assist you today?")
elise.save_audio(audio_output, "output.wav")
```

Make sure to adjust the parameters according to your needs. For more detailed usage, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Fine-Tuning Process

Fine-tuning the model involves several steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse set of audio samples and corresponding text transcripts.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for training. This includes normalizing audio levels and tokenizing text.
3. **Training**: Use the collected data to fine-tune the model. Monitor the loss and adjust parameters as necessary.
4. **Evaluation**: Test the model's performance on a separate validation set to ensure quality.
5. **Deployment**: Once satisfied with the results, deploy the model in your application.
